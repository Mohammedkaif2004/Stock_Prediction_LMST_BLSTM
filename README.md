# üìà Apple Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM

This project explores the use of LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM models for predicting Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices based on historical time series data. The goal is to understand how different time step sizes affect prediction performance.

## üß† Models Used

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
- **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)**

Each model was trained with 3 different time step sizes: **100**, **125**, and **150**.

## üìä Performance Summary

### ‚úÖ LSTM Results
| Time Step | RMSE (Test Data) |
|-----------|------------------|
| 100       | *Good*      |
| 125       | *Moderate*          |
| 150       | **Best (‚úîÔ∏è)** - **RMSE: 7.21**

LSTM performed best with **150** time steps.

### ‚úÖ BiLSTM Results
| Time Step | RMSE (Test Data) |
|-----------|------------------|
| 100       | *Moderate*       |
| 125       | **Best (‚úîÔ∏è)** - **RMSE: 5.03** |
| 150       | **Worst** - RMSE: 39.53 üòû

BiLSTM performed best with **125** time steps.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure
Both models were trained using historical stock data to learn price patterns and trends. The trained models were also used to predict stock prices for the next 60 days. These future predictions are not guaranteed to be accurate but serve as a potential trend estimation for educational and research purposes.
